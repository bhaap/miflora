miflora - Library for Xiaomi Mi plant sensor
============================================

Now with Pygatt-BGAPI thanks to rileyhome @ homeassistant community forum.

This library lets you read sensor data from a Xiaomi Mi Flora plant sensor.

It supports reading

- temperature

- moisture

- fertility

- light intensity

This code atm works ONLY if you have a Bluegiga BGAPI compatible board (like the BLED112 USB dongle)
